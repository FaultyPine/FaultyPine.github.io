Maybe have different pages for non-game
Move/remove favorite games icons
Brag in the intro lines in home page
Mention mods and games and netcode stuff in intro
Get cool stuff on homepage
List of 10ish of coolest things - how many can you get into second paragraph of intro (make some of them links)
Maybe put the WFC visualizer further up? Right when you get to homepage on the side??
Make hobbies with fav games at bottom ---- group personal stuff together near end since it isn't as important
maybe put the line that's under the resume on the home page
